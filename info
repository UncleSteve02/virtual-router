same as echo request but recompute icmp checksum


PART 2
-checksum/ttl working correctly (change prefs in wireshark to enable check for checksums)
-Get packet
	1. is it for us? if yes, done, else continue
	2. is checksum correct? if no, drop
	3. is ttl > 1? if no, drop and send icmp. if yes, reduce ttl (by one), recalc checksum
	4. check forwaring table. if no match, send icmp error
	5. find dst mac addr using ARP, if none, send icmp error
	6. assemble packet, send it
-test part 2
	ping
	traceroute
	netcat: "netcat -l port" -h1; "netcat Ip port" -h2
